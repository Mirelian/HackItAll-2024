LangChain has a number of components designed to help build question-answering applications, and RAG applications more generally. To familiarize ourselves with these, we’ll build a simple Q&A application over a text data source. Along the way we’ll go over a typical Q&A architecture, discuss the relevant LangChain components, and highlight additional resources for more advanced Q&A techniques. We’ll also see how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application. LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in complexity.
